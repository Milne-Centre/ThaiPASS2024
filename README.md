## Description of the current folders:

### Exoplanets
Tasks for "Exoplanets" material.

For students with little or no Python experience, we recommend that you register and work on the basic Python ThaiMOOC by Dr Teeraparb Chantavat.

The exercise will be in the form of an iPython notebook which you can use Anaconda to open (using the Jupyter Notebook application).


## How to use GitHub

Using GitHub is a great tool for professionals who write programs. What makes it so great to use is that if there changes to the docts and pieces of written code, usually to fix problems or 'bugs', they can be uploaded to Git Hub and then everyone that uses the code from that repository can then update their versions quickly and simply 'at the push of a button'.

Now, we should start by downloading everything on this repository. To do this we will use the git hub desktop software: for Apple MacOS users [click here](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin "Git Hub MacOS"), for Microsoft Windows OS users [click here](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32 "Git Hub Windows OS"). 

Once downloaded, Windows OS users should proceed to install the software onto your machines by double-clicking on the downloaded file and following the on-screen instructions; MacOS users only have to 'unzip' the file and the application can be loaded straight away by double-clicking on the unzipped file. 

When you have loaded the application, there will be a screen that will ask you if you would like to "sign-in' into a Git Hub account, you may click on "skip this step" as it is not necessary.

The next screen will ask you to input your name and e-mail address, please do fill in each of these fields and then continue onto the next page. We will detail how to download a repository below. 

#### Downloading Repositories using GitHub 

We will now guide you through downloading (known as "cloning") a repository from git hub using the desktop software

- You should now have a screen like the one below:

- Please click on "Clone a Repository", you will then be presented with the box with different 'tabs' to choose from, select "URL" (see below). 

- Then copy and past this link, https://github.com/Milne-Centre/ThaiPASS2021.git, into the Repository URL Box. You then may choose the location on where the folders and files from the repository are downloaded/cloned to by clicking on the "Choose..." button.

- When you are happy with the location of your cloned directory, press the blue "Clone" button in the bottom-right corner of the box.

#### Updating Repositories using GitHub

During the week of the school, we may add new things to this repository. So, we will need to update what we have already downloaded.

- To do this in 'Git Hub Desktop', select "ThaiPASS2021" on the left hand side of the git hub desktop window (see the red arrow in image below), if it is not already selected.

- With the "ThaiPASS2021" repository selected within git hub desktop, now click the "Fetch Origin" button (as indicated by the blue arrow).

You now have updated the repository with the latest changes and files.
