In this session we will be using a very large dataset. There are two ways to use this data. 

1. Download the dataset to your own machine from the link below. This is compressed, please be aware that when extracted, the total size of these files is 2.1GB.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VP9YuT79LZaBMDrhnhlbH_uA_qUzWLni/view?usp=share_link

Or

2. Use Google Colab to write your python code and you will be able to read the data directly from my google drive.
To do this, please see the files here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17UqU1adZRsyuRZ2MCf0kRWgohcleggP-?usp=share_link
Click on the three dots on the right of the 'Galaxy_zoo' folder, select 'organise', then 'add shortcut' and 'my drive'.
This action will add a shortcut to this folder to your own google drive. You can then read from this folder in Google Colab

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
data_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/Galaxy_Zoo/'

Check the contents:

! ls '/content/drive/My Drive/Galaxy_Zoo/'

This will allow you to read and use the data without downloading the data to your own machine or to your own google drive.
