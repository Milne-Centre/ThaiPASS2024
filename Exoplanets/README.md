# ThaiPASS2024 - Exoplanets

##########################################

Welcome to the Exoplanets project!

You can find the project questions in the file: Exoplanets.ipynb

There are 4 parts in the project. The first 2 are not that difficult but the last 2 may be a bit more challenging. There are quite a few questions so feel free to skip those one labeled as "optional". Just try to answer as many questions you can but don't worrry if you cannot answer all of them! 

I hope you will enjoy this project and learn some interesting things!
