# ThaiPASS2021 - Exoplanets

##########################################

Welcome to the Exoplanets project!

You can find the project questions in the file: Exoplanets.ipynb

There are 4 parts in the project. The first 2 are not that difficult but the last 2 may be a bit more challenging. There are quite a few questions so feel free to skip those one labeled as "optional". Just try to answer as many questions you can but don't worrry if you cannot answer all of them! 

Before trying the questions please watch the "Exoplanets Lecture" (available from 14th May) and the "Exoplanets Project Overview" (available from 17th May) on the YouTube channel. At all times feel free to ask questions on Slack. 

I hope you will enjoy this project and learn some interesting things!
