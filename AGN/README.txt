Hi!
If you are looking for the data files, I have it here:

Since the files are quite large, you might want to start downloading it first thing in the morning.

The workbooks are basically guided by the tasks and deducted parts of the solutions. 
If you see "...", that means you need to think of something and debug/fix the code there. 
You can also opt to write the entirety of the code in each block on your own too.
